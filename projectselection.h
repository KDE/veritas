/**
 * KSelectAction for selecting one of the opened projects.
 * The list contains an item for each opened project, and there can be only one
 * project selected at a time.
 *
 * However, not every project may be selectable. Under some circumstances, a
 * project shouldn't be selected (for example, if something is missed in its
 * configuration), so the projects to be selected can be filtered. Note that the
 * filtered project will still be shown, but it will be disabled.
 *
 * A subclass of ProjectSelection::IProjectFilter must be implemented with the
 * desired filter behavior, and a new object of this class must be set in
 * ProjectSelection constructor. The ProjectSelection takes ownership of the
 * filter, so it is deleted when the ProjectSelection is destroyed.
 *
 * The ProjectSelection is updated whenever a project is opened, updated or
 * closed. If a project is opened, it is added to the ProjectSelection and
 * enabled or disabled depending on the filter. If an already opened project is
 * updated (its configuration changed) it is enabled or disabled depending on
 * the filter. If it is disabled and it was the currently selected project, it
 * will be deselected. If an already opened project is closed, it is removed
 * from the ProjectSelection. If it was the currently selected project, it will
 * be deselected.
 *
 * Whenever a project is selected by the user or deselected due to any of the
 * above circumstances, projectSelected(KDevelop::IProject*) signal is emitted.
 *
 * The ProjectSelection can be shown as a widget through
 * QWidgetAction::requestWidget(QWidget*). It will return a combobox with the
 * given parent showing the projects to be selected.
 * \code
 * projectSelection = new ProjectSelection(parent, projectFilter);
 * projectSelection->setToolBarMode(KSelectAction::ComboBoxMode);
 * projectSelectionWidget = projectSelection->requestWidget(parentWidget);
 * layout->addWidget(projectSelectionWidget);
 * \endcode
 *
 * If the ProjectSelection is going to be added to a QToolBar (as it inherits
 * QAction), it can be shown instead as a button with "Project" label that pop
 * ups the added projects to be selected using
 * setToolBarMode(KSelectAction::ToolBarMode) with KSelectAction::MenuMode
 * parameter, and adding the ProjectSelection to the QToolBar.
 * \code
 * projectSelection = new ProjectSelection(parent, projectFilter);
 * projectSelection->setToolBarMode(KSelectAction::MenuMode);
 * toolBar->addAction(projectSelection);
 * \endcode
